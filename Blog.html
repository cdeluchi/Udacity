                <h3>What is IHIA?</h3>

                <p>
                    The objective of the Heute Institute for Incentive to Art - IHIA is to raise incentives for the people who want to start
                    to learn any kind of art, expanding their knowledge and love for art.
                    
                    What we have today:
                    
                    In Videira - Santa Catarina - Brazil we have a group of music students who enjoy classes with teachers from the region
                    and instruments provided by the Associação Música Viva.
                </br>
                </br>
                    This association is an independent body under the responsibility of Camerata de Videira and Banda Sinfônica de Videira.
                    At least 160 students are providing by Associação Música Viva.
            </br>
            </br>
                    
                    The association bears all costs for teachers, events and maintenance of the Videira event center.
                    Each year the association runs 5 free events and some fundraising events.
                    These resources are brought with events made by the association in conjunction with the state government and companies
                    in the region. However, the funds raised from these events are not enough to cover all the annual expenses of the
                    association and we were unable to bring in more students to take classes.
                    
                    <blockquote>“Pray to catch the bus, then run as fast as you can.”
                    ― Julia Cameron</blockquote>
                    
                    Attract people from Videira and region for classes, workshops and presentations.
                    Create the desire of these people to be inserted in this world, in this lifestyle. Children, youth and adults who would
                    not have the opportunity to access art. People who can be benefited and encouraged to have a better life.
                    Art in all its forms, music, dance, interpretation, writing, reading, photographed, painted.
                    <br>
                    </br>
                    Paying and non-paying students, today AMV already has the form of merit for these students, but we would like to be able
                    to offer scholarships for these students. Being able to offer money so that these students are not deprived of studying,
                    of having access to art because they need to help their parents bring money home. In addition to having food for these
                    students to be able to eat inside the center, before classes.
                    <br>
                    </br>
                    Work together with schools in the region so that these hours of study of art practice they can use as extracurricular
                    activities and this will be part of the grades in the final exams.
                    This will also happen in private schools, so that in this way we have paying students who can help with the costs of the
                    Association.
