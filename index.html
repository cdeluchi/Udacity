                <p>
                    The goal of the <strong>Heute Institute for Incentive to Art - IHIA</strong>  is to raise incentives for the people who want to start
                    to learn any kind of art, expanding their knowledge and love for art.
                    
                    What we have today:
                    
                    In <em>Videira - Santa Catarina - Brazil</em> we have a group of music students who enjoy classes with teachers from the region
                    and instruments provided by the Associação Música Viva. <br>
                </br>
                    
                    This association is an independent body under the responsibility of Camerata de Videira and Banda Sinfônica de Videira.
                    At least 160 students are providing by Associação Música Viva. </br>
                </br>
                    
                    
                    The association bears all costs for teachers, events and maintenance of the Videira event center.
                    Each year the association runs <u>5 free events</u>  and some fundraising events. 
                    These resources are brought with events made by the association in conjunction with the state government and companies
                    in the region. However, the funds raised from these events are <u>not enough to cover all the annual expenses</u>  of the
                    association and we were unable to bring in more students to take classes.
